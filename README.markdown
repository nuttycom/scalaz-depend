**scalaz-depend** is an example of a project which depends on Scalaz

### Goal

* Depend on Scalaz
* Be able to develop alongside Scalaz with incremental compilation
* Proguard the result into a JAR file that will run independently of Scala runtime (also, a regular JAR requiring Scala)
* Digitally sign both JAR files
* Tests using ScalaCheck
* Swing application example
